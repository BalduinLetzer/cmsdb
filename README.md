# cmsdb

Database of physics processes, cross sections and scientific constants as well as CMS-related campaign information on datasets.

[order](https://github.com/riga/order) is used to model the relations between physics meta data containers (datasets, processes, systematics, ...).
Numeric values with multiple sources of systematic uncertainties are defined using [scinum](https://github.com/riga/scinum).
